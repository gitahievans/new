Project Title: Dictionary App
Name: Evans Gitahi
Project description:
    The purpose of this application is to enable a user to know the following for english words:
        1. Meaning  
        2. Pronunciation 
        3. Example of use in a sentence
        4. Type of word
        5. Synonym 

    The app has the following features:
        1. An input bar - user inputs here the word for which they want to gethe meaning.
        2. A search button - the user clicks this button to search word meanings.
        3. A voice button - the user clicks this button to hear the pronunciation of the word they searched.

    The above functionalities will be enabled through JavaScript programming. Event listeners available in the dictionary app will be ‘DOMContent loaded’, click for the search icon and ‘click’ for the pronunciation button. HTML will be used to create the document while CSS will be used to style the document.
    
    API: Free dictionary API
        I will use the API to access data that is the meaning of the words and their synonyms. The API provides the data in JSON format. I will therefore have to convert it in Javascript code for easy access of the elements.
    
    Challenges:
        Details such as example in a sentence, synonyms and pronunciation are not available for all words.
